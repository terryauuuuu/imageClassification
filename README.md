## This is a simple machine learning model which based on an example in Keras under the topic image classification
## LeNet structure from Keras has been miplemented to train the model

##The train data and test data was generated byby ImageMagick using generate_images.py as below:
`python generate_data_images.py <type> <numberOfImagesPerClass>`
type = [test, train]
numberOfImagesPerClass = integers 

##The model has been trained by the tested data and training data using train_mode.py
`python train_model.py`

##Execute the command below and it will generate an image on the current directory, then it predict its words and output the result via the console
`python generate_images.py `

##'predict.py' would be called by `generate_images.py `
